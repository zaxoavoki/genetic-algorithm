# Genetic Algorithm

Algorithm for print circuit layout optimization.

## How it works

To represent an entire map we use the Individual class. To represent a path on map use Path class and Segment for one part of a path.

A single segment contains direction and distance (eg. `'U', 1` - move up with distance 1).
